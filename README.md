# Dynamic-Model-of-underactuated-five-link-biped-robot
This project contains two MATLAb functions which used to obtain the dynamic model of underactuated five-link biped robot.

First file ( Generlazed.m) used to generate the dynamic model as a function of the absolut angles which are the angles between each link of the biped and the vertical axis.

Second File (Relative.m) used to obtain the dynamic model of the biped as a function of the relative or the controlled joint angles.

Third file is Lagrange's equations which calculate equations of motion, I downloaded this function from this link ( https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23037-lagrange-s-equations )

Absolute angles are: theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5.

Relative angles are: q0, q1, q2, q3, q4.

Also, there is a file named Biped.pdf contain the schematic diagram of the biped with all absolute and relative angles.

The model is taken from the paper under title " Tzafestas, S., Raibert, M., & Tzafestas, C. (1996). Robust sliding-mode control applied to a 5-link biped robot. Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems, 15(1), 67-133."
